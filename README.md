# Hello!

I'm Ana, a third-year student in Software Engineering student at McGill University. With hands-on experience as a Product Management and Developer Intern, Iâ€™ve contributed to projects that span across web development, data analytics, and automation.

My skills include Python, Java, C, Bash, SQL, Django, Git, Docker, and Power BI. I thrive on solving complex problems and love contributing to projects that make a difference.

Let's keep in touch :)
